The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively.

    <h4 class="heading-51">12. Binding Individual Arbitration.<br></h4>
    <p class="paragraph-52"><strong>“Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and Square, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in any way to this Agreement or the Developer Tools. Subject to applicable law, you and Square agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org), where such arbitration is conducted in the United States, or JAMS (https://www.jamsadr.com) or the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Canada (https://www.icdr.org), where such arbitration is conducted in Canada. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies to any arbitration that takes place within the United States. Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use under a consumer protection law of a province or territory, any arbitration hearing will occur within such jurisdiction and be governed by the laws of such jurisdiction. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in (a) Toronto, Ontario, for Disputes; (b) another mutually agreeable location; or (c) a location ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. We will pay the arbitration fees due to the arbitrator for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to legal fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our legal fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Square also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) involving Square will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the provincial or federal courts in the City of Toronto, Ontario.</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-51">13. Governing Law.<br></h4>
    <p class="paragraph-52"><strong>This Agreement and any Dispute will be governed by Ontario law and/or applicable Canadian federal law, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction.</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-51">14. Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute.<br></h4>
    <p class="paragraph-52"><strong>Unless otherwise required by law, an action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-51">15. Assignment.<br></h4>
    <p class="paragraph-52"><strong>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-51">16. Other Provisions.<br></h4>
    <p class="paragraph-52"><strong>These Developer Terms of Service and any other applicable terms or policies, are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Square regarding the Developer Tools. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. The Agreement does not limit any rights that Square may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</strong></p>
