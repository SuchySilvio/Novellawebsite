    <h5 class="heading-45">BACKGROUND</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-50"><strong>Subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph, Afterpay Canada Limited (“APM Provider”) provides the Payment Method and related marketing and promotional services to Merchants in the relevant Territories selling Goods online and through other agreed sales channels. The Payment Method and related marketing and promotional services to Merchants, at APM Provider’s sole discretion, may be provided by the APM Provider or such other of its Affiliates as the APM Provider may determine. For clarity, this may be, but is not limited to, to comply with legal or regulatory compliance requirements in a relevant jurisdiction and/or for commercial purposes.As an alternative to a direct integration and direct contractual relationship between APM Provider and Merchant for the provision of the Payment Method as described in the foregoing paragraph, the Payment Method is now offered through Square Technologies, Inc. (“PSP”) to Merchants who qualify with a direct integration through the PSP Platform provided they comply with these Scheme Rules (“Services”). Related marketing and promotional services to Merchants arising out of or related to the Services shall be managed in accordance with clause 4 of these Scheme Rules.Accordingly, Merchant shall adhere and comply with the following terms and conditions under the Scheme Rules for the Services. The Scheme Rules may be updated from time to time. Where the Scheme Rules are revised, PSP shall make such updated rules available to Merchants for review.For the avoidance of doubt, the Scheme Rules set forth below are not intended to, and do not, create any direct, contractual relationship between Afterpay Canada Limited and the Merchant. The Merchant agrees to be bound by the Scheme Rules under the terms of the Agreement entered into between the Merchant and Square Technologies, Inc. Any references in the Scheme Rules below to APM Provider shall be read to be references to PSP (i.e., Square Technologies, Inc.). PSP takes on all responsibility for compliance with the Scheme Rules and passes on those obligations to the Merchant under theAgreement. PSP acknowledges and agrees that Afterpay Canada Limited (APM Provider) has no right of enforcement against the Merchant under the Scheme Rules.Merchant attests that its use of the Services is for business purposes and not for personal, family or household purposes. The arrangement for the sale by Merchant to Customers of any Goods is a separate consumer contract between Merchant and each Customer and the Customer’s rights and remedies as a consumer in respect of that sale by Merchant (including any Return of those Goods) are as between Merchant and the Customer, to the exclusion of APM Provider and PSP.</strong></p>
