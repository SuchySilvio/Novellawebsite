    <div class="text-block-50"><strong>Effective Date: May 20, 2022</strong></div>
    <p class="paragraph-49"><strong>By using Square Point of Sale (formerly Register) and any associated products and services (the “Services”), you agree to be bound by the </strong>
      <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/legal/ua"><strong>General Terms</strong></a><strong>, these additional terms and conditions (“Additional Point of Sale Terms”), and all other terms, policies, and guidelines applicable to the Services used including, but not limited to, the </strong>
      <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/legal/payment"><strong>Payment Terms</strong></a><strong> if you accept payments through Square. If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you agree that you accept all these terms, and have authority to enter into these terms, on behalf of that business. Defined terms have the same meaning as in the General Terms.</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="text-block-50"><strong>1. Gift Cards</strong></div>
    <p class="paragraph-49"><strong>If you purchase and offer gift cards to your customers through Square, you (and not Square) are the issuer and administrator of your gift cards. If you have multiple business locations and do not manage your locations through a single Square account, you must separately order gift cards for each business location where you wish to issue and redeem gift cards and print that business location on your gift cards.Gift cards sold by you are “closed loop” gift cards that are only redeemable from you for your goods and services. You agree to pay our </strong>
      <a href="https://squareup.com/help/ca/en/article/5068-what-are-square-s-fees"><strong>Fees</strong></a><strong> (as defined in the Payment Terms) on each issue of a gift card as well as all order, printing, and shipping fees for each order of gift cards. Square does not assess a fee on the redemption of a gift card to purchase goods or services from you, and you may not assess or impose any fees or charges on the issuance, maintenance, or redemption of gift cards. You may not issue a gift card with a value in excess of $2,000 or add value to a previously issued gift card so that the total funds loaded on a gift card in any single day exceed $2,000. Further, you may not issue more than $10,000 in gift cards to any single person in any one day. You may not impose an expiration date on gift cards, and any unused balance of a gift card must remain available to the holder of the gift card until fully redeemed, even if your Square Account is closed, suspended, or terminated. You may not provide a cash refund from or cash back on gift cards except to the extent required by applicable law. Gift cards may not be used for payment of a credit account.At the time you issue a gift card, you must clearly disclose on the gift card itself, and on any packaging and promotional materials associated with the gift card, any restrictions, limitations and terms and conditions in respect of the use of such gift card, as well as contact information for the purpose of obtaining information about the gift card, including any remaining balance. If a purchase exceeds the holder’s gift card balance, the holder must pay the remaining amount with another payment method. All gift cards and the funds associated with gift cards are your sole property. Any liability for the use or misuse of your gift cards, and any third party claims arising from or relating to your gift cards, are your sole responsibility.You are solely responsible for compliance with federal, provincial, territorial, and local laws, rules and regulations that apply to your gift cards, including but not limited to notice, disclosure requirements and language requirements (including, without limitation, pursuant to the Charter of the French Language (Quebec), as applicable), expiration dates and fees, refunds, unclaimed property or escheat requirements (such as tracking, reporting, and remittance of unclaimed property balances in all states), and customer service for buyers and holders of gift cards.</strong>
