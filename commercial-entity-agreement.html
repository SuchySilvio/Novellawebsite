    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>This Commercial Entity Agreement (this “Agreement”) is provided to all users of the Square Canada, Inc. (“Square”) mobile application, card reader devices, and payments service (collectively, the “Square Service”) for the acceptance of card payments that are “Commercial Entities” as defined by Visa, Inc. and MasterCard International, Inc. (collectively, the “Card Brands”). As such an entity, the seller signing or electronically agreeing to the terms hereof (“Seller” or “you”) is entering into this Agreement with Paymentech, LLC (“Paymentech”), The Bank of Nova Scotia and First Data Loan Company, Canada, Paymentech’s sponsors in Canada (collectively referred to herein as “Members”), to govern the authorization, conveyance and settlement of Transactions utilizing the Square Service. By entering into this Agreement Seller is fulfilling the Card Brand Rules requiring a direct contractual relationship between the Members and Seller, and Seller is agreeing to comply with Card Brand Rules as they pertain to payments Seller receives through the Square Service. Paymentech shall be a third-party beneficiary of, and may enforce any provisions of, or cease providing card processing services under, the General Terms of Service or any Additional Terms (collectively, “Terms of Service”).</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-48">1. Card Brand Rules and Acceptance Requirements.</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller agrees to comply with all Card Brand Rules as may be applicable to Seller and in effect from time to time, and such other procedures as Square and/or Paymentech may from time to time prescribe relating to Seller’s acceptance of Cards. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller agrees to each of the following requirements and restrictions:</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.1 Bona Fide Transactions.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller shall not submit any Transaction that is not a bona fide Transaction. A “bona fide” Transaction means a Transaction that is (i) between the Seller and its Customer, (ii) for the sale of goods and/or services (or a refund for such a sale) that are Seller’s property or that Seller has the legal right to sell, (iii) submitted on behalf of Seller (and not on behalf of any third party), and (iv) legal, authorized by the Customer, non-fraudulent or otherwise damaging to the Card Brand(s), and is, to the Seller’s knowledge, enforceable, collectible, and in full compliance with this Agreement, applicable law, or Card Brand Rules.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.2 Minimum/Maximum Thresholds For Card Acceptance; Surcharges.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Except as expressly permitted by law, Seller shall not (i) set a dollar amount above or below which Seller refuses to honor Cards or (ii) impose or require the Customer to pay any fee or charge (including, without limitation, any surcharge or finance charge or any of the fees payable by Seller under this Agreement) in connection with or as a condition of the use or acceptance of a Card.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.3 Split Transactions.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller agrees to submit a single Transaction for the full amount of each sale. Seller shall not split a single Transaction into two or more Transactions, except to allow for partial payment by prepaid or gift Card.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.4 Taxes.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller shall not add any tax or surcharge to Transactions, unless applicable law expressly allows or requires the Seller to impose such tax or surcharge. If any tax or surcharge amount is allowed, such amount shall be included in the Transaction amount and shall not be collected separately.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.5 Use of Card Account Numbers.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller shall not request or use Card Information for any purpose except as payment for its goods or services or to provide a refund for goods or services previously sold, unless required by the Card Brand Rules. Seller agrees that (i) it will not use the Card Information for any purpose that it knows or should know to be fraudulent or in violation of any Card Brand Rules; (ii) it will not sell, purchase, provide or exchange in any manner or disclose Card Information to anyone other than Square, any Card Brand, or in response to a government request; and (iii) it will be compliant with the Security Standards, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and will cooperate in a forensic investigation if so required.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.6 Existing Debt.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller shall not submit a Transaction for any purpose other than a current Transaction. Transactions shall not represent the collection of a dishonored check or the collection, transfer or refinancing of any existing or prior debt or obligation. Seller shall not attempt to recharge a Customer for an item that has been the subject of a Chargeback by the Customer, even with the Customer’s consent. Seller shall not submit any Transaction which it knows or should know to be unenforceable or uncollectable.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.7 Time of Payment.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>At the time Seller accepts a Card for any goods or services, the goods shall have been provided or shipped or the services actually rendered to the Customer, except as specifically stated otherwise in Seller’s Application (or otherwise approved in writing by Paymentech in advance).</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.8 Cash Advances.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller shall not disburse or advance any cash to a Customer (except as authorized by the Card Brand Rules) or to itself or any of its representatives, agents, or employees in connection with a Transaction, nor shall Seller accept payment for effecting credits or issuing refunds to a Customer.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.9 Discrimination.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Unless permitted by the Card Brand Rules, Seller shall not engage in any practice that unfavorably discriminates against or provides unequal treatment of any Card Brand relative to any other Card Brand.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.10 Refunds/Credits.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Any Transaction submitted to Paymentech to credit a Customer’s Card account represents a refund for a prior Transaction submitted to Paymentech using the same Card.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.11 Installment Plans.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Unless specifically stated in its Application or otherwise approved in writing by Paymentech in advance, Seller shall not accept Cards in connection with installment plans. If the Customer pays in installments or on a deferred payment plan, as previously approved by Paymentech, a Transaction Data record has been prepared separately for each installment transaction or deferred payment on the dates the Customer agreed to be charged. All installments and deferred payments, whether or not they have been submitted to Paymentech for processing, shall be deemed to be a part of the original Transaction.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.12 Recurring Transactions.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>For recurring Transactions, if any, permitted by the Terms of Service, Seller must (i) obtain the Customer’s consent to periodically charge the Customer on a recurring basis for the goods or services purchased; (ii) retain this permission for the duration of the recurring services and provide it upon request to Paymentech or the issuing bank of the Customer’s Card; and (iii) retain written documentation specifying the frequency of the recurring charge, and the duration of time during which such charges may be made, and the amount or range of amounts that may be charged. Seller shall not submit any recurring transaction after receiving: (i) a cancellation notice from the Customer (so long as such notice was timely provided three (3) or more days prior to the transaction date); or (ii) notice from Paymentech or any Card Brand (via authorization code or otherwise) that the Card is not to be honored. Seller shall include in its Transaction Data the electronic indicator that the Transaction is a recurring Transaction.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.13 Seller Identification.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller agrees to prominently and unequivocally inform the Customer of the identity of the Seller at all points of interaction.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.14 Visa and MasterCard Marks.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller is authorized to use the Visa and MasterCard logos or marks only on Seller’s promotional materials and website to indicate that Visa and MasterCard cards are accepted as funding sources for Square Transactions.</strong></p>
    <h6 class="heading-49">1.15 Chargebacks.</h6>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller shall use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with the Customer. Should a Chargeback dispute occur, Seller shall promptly comply with all requests for information from Square. Seller shall not attempt to recharge a Customer for an item that has been charged back to the Customer, even with the Customer’s consent. You shall have full liability for the amount of any and all successful Chargebacks (and may have conditional liability for such Chargebacks prior to their final adjudication pursuant to the Card Brand Rules).</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-48">2. Authorizations Required For All Transactions.</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller is required to obtain an authorization through the Square Service, in accordance with this Agreement, for each Transaction. Paymentech reserves the right to refuse to process any Transaction Data presented by Seller unless it includes a proper authorization.</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-48">3. Refunds.</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Seller is required to maintain a refund policy if Seller limits refund/exchange terms or other specific conditions for Card Transactions, Seller’s policy must be clearly provided to the Customer prior to the sale and as part of the sale confirmation process. Proper disclosure would include wording that is prominently displayed and states “NO REFUND, EXCHANGE ONLY” or something substantially similar and includes any special terms. Qualifying Seller’s refund or exchange terms does not completely eliminate Seller’s liability for a refund because consumer protection laws and Card Brand Rules frequently allow the Customer to still dispute these items. If, under Seller’s refund policy, Seller allows a refund, Seller shall implement such refund within three (3) days of approving the Customer’s request for such refund. The amount of a refund cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original Transaction Data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the Customer for shipping charges that the Customer paid to return merchandise. Seller shall not accept any payment from a Customer as consideration for issuing a refund.</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-48">4. Term and Termination.</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>This Agreement is effective upon the date Seller agrees to it (by electronically indicating acceptance hereof or otherwise) and continues so long as Seller uses the Square Service or until terminated by Seller or Paymentech. This Agreement will terminate automatically upon any termination or expiration of your Terms of Service. This Agreement may be terminated by Paymentech at any time based on a breach of any of Seller’s obligations under this Agreement or the Terms of Service, or based on the termination of the payment processing relationship between Square and Paymentech. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Paymentech may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Seller as a result of any of the following events: (a) irregular Transactions by Seller, excessive Chargebacks, or any other circumstances which, in Paymentech’s discretion, may increase Paymentech’s or Members’ exposure for Seller’s Chargebacks or otherwise present an unreasonable anticipated financial, reputational, or legal risk to Paymentech; (b) Seller fails in any material respect in performance or observance of any term, covenant, condition, or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Terms of Service, including, without limitation, the funding or establishing of any reserve account which Square may require; (c) a case or other proceeding shall be commenced by or against Seller in any court of competent jurisdiction seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other laws, domestic or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding up, or adjustment of debts, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator, or the like of Seller, or of all or any substantial part of the assets, domestic or foreign, of Seller, and such case or proceeding shall continue undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 consecutive days, or an order granting the relief requested in such case or proceeding against Seller (including, without limitation, an order for relief under the Bankruptcy Code) shall be entered; (d) any Card Brand notifies Paymentech or Member that it is no longer willing to accept Seller’s Transaction Data or requires Paymentech or Member to terminate or limit this Agreement; (e) Seller or any person owning or controlling Seller’s business is listed in one or more databases of terminated or high risk Sellers maintained by the Card Brands; or (f) Seller engages in conduct that creates or could tend to create harm or loss to the goodwill of any Card Brand, Paymentech, or Square, or which otherwise may impose undue risk of harm to any Card Brand, Paymentech or Square. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, those terms which by their nature are intended to survive termination (including without limitation, indemnification obligations and limitations of liability) shall survive.Termination does not affect either party’s respective rights and obligations under this Agreement as to Transaction Data submitted before termination.</strong></p>
