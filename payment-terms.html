    <h5 class="heading-36"><strong>Payment Services</strong></h5>
    <h5 class="heading-37">1. Our Role</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Square is a payment facilitator and acquirer that allows you to accept Cards (as defined below) from customers and offer other non-Card payment methods (such as Afterpay) from time to time (“Other Payment Methods”) for the payment for goods and services. We are not a financial institution as defined in the Bank Act (Canada) and do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. Square Canada’s Payment Services allow you to accept payments from any Canadian issued and most non-Canadian issued credit, debit, prepaid, or gift cards (collectively, “Cards”) bearing the trademark of the American Express Company, Inc. (“American Express”), along with credit and debit card payments bearing the trademark of Visa Inc. (“Visa”) processed using the Visa Merchant Direct Exchange, credit and debit card payments bearing the trademark of Mastercard Inc. (“Mastercard”) processed using the Mastercard Interface Processor and debit card payments on the Interac Corp. network (“Interac”) and through Other Payment Methods. Our Payment Services allow you to accept payments from Cards bearing the trademarks of Discover Financial Services, Inc. (“Discover”) and JCB Co., Ltd. (“JCB”), (together with American Express, Visa, Mastercard and Interac and their respective affiliates, collectively, the “Networks”). By accepting or otherwise agreeing to these Payment Terms, you agree to accept all of these payment methods from the Networks. We may remove or add Cards or Other Payment Methods that we accept at any time without prior notice. If at any time you decide you no longer want to accept one or more of the payment methods from one or more Networks, or no longer want to accept Other Payment Methods, you may cancel or, in the case of Other Payment Methods, opt-out, without penalty.In order to serve in this role, we must enter into agreements with Networks, processors, acquiring banks and other providers. In some cases, the Networks require that any person that signs up for a Square Account to use Payment Services (a “Seller”) and processes more than Network specified amounts of Card sales enter into an agreement directly with Square’s acquiring bank. By accepting or otherwise agreeing to these Payment Terms, you agree to the terms and conditions of the “</strong>
      <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/legal/cea"><strong>Commercial Entity Agreement</strong></a><strong>” effective as of the date you process such specified amounts. If you fail to agree to the Commercial Entity Agreement, we may suspend or terminate your Square Account. Similarly, if American Express considers you to be a high value customer, it may require that you maintain your agreement directly with American Express and designate Square as your agent for American Express payments. If that is the case, we will notify you of such requirement.<br><br> Offline Mode<br>When you enable offline payments, your POS approves payments before the money is received from the Buyer’s account. That means it is possible that you will not receive the money for the goods that are taken by the Buyer. There’s also a higher risk that card fraud goes undetected. You acknowledge the increased risk of expired or declined transactions, chargebacks, and disputes related to payments that you process offline and agree to be fully liable for them.You can reduce your exposure by setting a transaction limit before you take offline payments. Payments taken in offline mode expire after 24 hours. You must always reconnect to the internet within this timeframe for payments to process.<br></strong>
    </p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">2. Your Authorization</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>In connection with the Payment Services, you authorize us to act as your agent for the limited purposes of holding, receiving, and disbursing funds on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to settle the proceeds of each Card and Other Payment Method transaction that you authorize, less any applicable Fees (as defined in Section 4) (“Proceeds”). Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until your Square Account is closed or terminated. Our receipt of transaction funds satisfies your customer’s obligations to make payment to you. We will remit to you funds actually received by us on your behalf, less amounts owed to us, subject to any Chargeback (as defined in Section 19) or Reserve (as defined in Section 15) withheld or applied. This authorization also permits us to debit any of your linked bank accounts at any time for the purposes specified in these Payment Terms and the General Terms. You also agree to be bound by any applicable rules of Payments Canada.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">3. Prohibited Industries</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>You may not use the Payment Services for the following businesses or business activities: (1) any illegal activity or goods, (2) paraphernalia that may be used for illegal activity, (3) buyers or membership clubs, including dues associated with such clubs, (4) credit counseling or credit repair agencies, (5) credit protection or identity theft protection services, (6) direct marketing or subscription offers or services, (7) infomercial sales, (8) internet/mail order/telephone order pharmacies or pharmacy referral services (where fulfillment of medication is performed with an internet or telephone consultation, absent a physical visit, including re-importation of pharmaceuticals from foreign countries), (9) unauthorized multi-level marketing businesses, (10) inbound or outbound telemarketers, (11) prepaid phone cards or phone services, (12) rebate based businesses, (13) up-sell merchants, (14) bill payment services, (15) betting, including lottery tickets, sports related gambling, casino gaming chips, off-track betting, and wagers at races, (16) manual or automated cash disbursements, (17) prepaid cards, cheques, insurance or other financial merchandise or services, (18) sales of money-orders or foreign currency, (19) wire transfer money orders, (20) high-risk products and services, including telemarketing sales, (21) automated fuel dispensers, (22) adult entertainment oriented products or services (in any medium, including internet, telephone, or printed material), (23) sales of (i) firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or (ii) weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury (24) internet/mail order/telephone order of age restricted products (e.g., beer, wine), (25) cigarettes or tobacco, (26) occult materials, (27) hate or harmful products, (28) escort services, (29) bankruptcy lawyers or collection agencies engaged in the collection of debt, or (30) travel agency services.<br><br>In addition, Other Payment Methods that we offer may have additional restrictions. Please review the terms provided for the specific Other Payment Method for further details.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">4. Our Fees</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>You agree to pay the applicable fees listed in these Payment Terms, on our </strong>
      <a href="https://squareup.com/help/ca/en/article/5068-what-are-square-s-fees"><strong>Fee Schedule</strong></a><strong>, and as described in your Dashboard for Card payments and Other Payment Methods (“Fees”) for use of the applicable Payment Services. All Fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds and thereafter from the Balance (as defined in Section 15) in your Square Account. Subject to the General Terms and these Payment Terms, we reserve the right to change our Fees upon notice that we deem reasonable in the circumstances or as may be required by applicable law and codes of conduct. You must agree to the change in Fees to continue to use the Payment Services. All Balances and all Fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Payment Services are denominated in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise specified.Note that Fees associated with Other Payment Methods, such as Afterpay, are subject to separate fee schedules. Please visit your Dashboard for further details.<br></strong>
    </p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">5. Processing Errors</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>We will attempt to fix processing errors we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of fewer funds than you were entitled, we will credit your Square Account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more funds than you were entitled, Square will debit the extra funds from your Square Account or your linked bank account. You are responsible for monitoring your transactions and ensuring that our payments to you are correct. You must notify us of any errors in payments made to you within sixty (60) days of the error first appearing on your electronic transaction history. Failure to notify us of a processing error within sixty (60) days will be deemed a waiver of any right to the amount applicable to the error. We will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if you notify us of such an error.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">6. Other Payment Methods</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>In addition to Card acceptance, Square may offer Other Payment methods to you. We may add or remove such Other Payment Methods at any time upon reasonable notice to you. Additional payment methods are subject to additional terms as follows:<em>Afterpay</em> - Afterpay is a Payment Service provided by Afterpay Canada Limited or its affiliates that allows you to offer your customers the ability to pay for goods or services in installments. By enabling and offering Afterpay, you agree to the </strong>
      <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/en/legal/general/afterpay-merchant-terms"><strong>Afterpay Merchant Terms and Conditions</strong></a><strong>.<br></strong>
    </p>
    <h5 class="heading-36"><strong>Payment Account Setup</strong></h5>
    <h5 class="heading-37">7. Square Account Registration for Payment Services</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>You must open a Square Account to access any Proceeds. You confirm that you are either a legal resident of Canada, a Canadian citizen, or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the province(s) or territory(ies) in which you operate and that you are an authorized signatory for the business you represent. You must use your or your business’ true and accurate name when opening a Square Account. This name will appear on the credit or debit card statements of your customers for all applicable payments you accept using the Payment Services. If a transaction dispute results from your failure to use a reasonably descriptive user name, you agree to indemnify Square for any costs stemming from such dispute.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">8. Underwriting and Identity Verification</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Square will review the information you submit while signing up for the Payment Services. You authorize Square to request identity verifying information about you, including, but not limited to, (a) a consumer and/or credit report that contains your name and address and may contain “credit information” such as age, occupation, place of residence, previous places of residence, marital status, spouse’s name and age, number of dependants, particulars of education or professional qualifications, places of employment, previous places of employment, estimated income, paying habits, outstanding debt obligations, cost of living obligations and assets and other personal information, and (b) to the extent applicable, a confirmation from the appropriate governmental authority of your corporation’s legal existence. Square may periodically obtain additional reports to determine whether you continue to meet the requirements for a Square Account. You permit Square to share information about you and your application (including whether you are approved or declined), and your Square Account with your bank or other financial institution, or as otherwise specified in the Privacy Policy. Square or its processor and/or acquiring bank, which may or may not be located in Canada, may conclude that you will not be permitted to use the Payment Services.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">9. Requests for Additional Information and Inspection</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Square may request additional information from you at any time. For example, Square may ask you to present invoices from your suppliers, a government issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, a business license, or other information. Square may also ask for permission to inspect your business location. If you refuse any of these requests, your Square Account may be suspended or terminated.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-36"><strong>Use of your Square Account for Payment Services</strong></h5>
    <h5 class="heading-37">10. Access to Proceeds</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>We will settle Proceeds to your verified bank account, subject to the payout schedule described in Section 12. If Square is not able to debit or credit the bank account you link to your Square Account, that bank account will be de-linked from your Square Account. If you do not have an ACSS-enabled bank account linked to your Square Account, you may request a physical cheque for Proceeds. Cheque requests may be subject to a processing fee and an identity verification process. You must request a cheque or link an ACSS-enabled bank account to your Square Account in order to receive your Proceeds.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">11. Right of Setoff</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you grant us a security interest in, as well as a right of setoff against, and assign, convey, deliver, pledge and transfer to us, as security for repayment of any obligations due under these Payment Terms, all of your right, title, and interest in and to all of your accounts with us. You authorize us, without prior notice to you and irrespective of (i) whether we have made demand under these Payment Terms or any other related agreements; and (ii) whether the obligation is contingent, matured or unmatured, to the extent permitted by law, to collect, charge, and/or setoff all sums owing on the indebtedness against any and all such accounts and other obligations, and our option, to administratively freeze or direct any third party bank holding the account to freeze all such accounts to allow us to protect our security interest, collection, charge and setoff rights as provided for in this section. For clarity, you agree that Square Canada may setoff amounts owed against funds held or processed by Square Technologies and that we may setoff amounts owed against funds held or processed by Square Canada or Square Technologies.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">12. Payout Schedule</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Square will automatically initiate a payout of Proceeds to your valid, linked Canadian bank account at the end of the business day. If you adjust your business’s close of day to a custom time, Square will group Proceeds for the 24-hour period preceding your custom time and initiate a payout at the end of that business day. Square will initiate a payout of Proceeds received on non-business days before the next business day.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">13. Availability of Proceeds</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>We may defer payout or restrict access to your Proceeds if we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your use of the Services. We also may defer payout or restrict access to your Proceeds as necessary to comply with applicable law or court order, or if requested by any governmental entity.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">14. Square Account History</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>When a payment is made to your Square Account, we will update your Square Account activity on the website and provide you a transaction confirmation. The confirmation will serve as your receipt. Summaries of your Square Account activity, including monthly statements, are available on our website for up to one year of account activity. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Square Account and your use of the Payment Services, and (b) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Square Account. If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Square Account, you must contact us immediately.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">15. Reserve for Holding Funds</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>We may withhold funds by temporarily suspending or delaying payment of Proceeds to you and/or designate an amount of funds that you must maintain in your Square Accounts or in a separate reserve account (a “Reserve”) to secure the performance of your obligations under any agreement between you and Square. We may require a Reserve for any reason related to your use of the Services. The Reserve will be in an amount as reasonably determined by us to cover potential losses to Square. The Reserve may be raised, reduced or removed at any time by Square, in its sole discretion, based on your payment history, a credit review, the amount of any arbitration award or court judgment against you in Square’s favor, or otherwise as Square or its processor may determine or require. If you do not have sufficient funds in your Reserve, we may fund the Reserve from any funding source associated with your Square Accounts, including any funds (a) transferred by you, (b) due to you, or (c) available in your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with us. Upon acceptance of these Payment Terms, you confirm that you have read, understood and accepted Square’s Pre-Authorized Debit Agreement. You agree to execute any additional documentation as may be required from time to time for us to debit your bank account as described in these Payment Terms. You grant us a security interest in and lien on any and all funds held in any Reserve, and also authorize us to make any withdrawals or debits from the Reserve or any bank account linked to any of your Square Accounts, without prior notice to you, to collect amounts that you owe us. You will execute any additional documentation required for us to perfect our security interest in any funds in the Reserve. This security interest survives for as long as we hold funds in your Reserve.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">16. Square Account Balances</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>While you have funds in your Square Account including but not limited to funds held within one or more folders (“Folders”) within your Square Account (together, your “Balance”), your Balance will be co-mingled and held with other participants’ funds in one or more pooled accounts at one or more banks by us on your behalf and for the benefit of you and others holding balances (each a “Pooled Account”). In the case of funds held in one or more Folders, Square will hold such funds in a Pooled Account separate and apart from its corporate funds and, subject to Square’s interest-earning rights detailed below, will not use such funds for corporate purposes. You acknowledge and agree that the value of the Balance is limited to the funds available in your Square Account from time to time. The funds associated with or accessible in your Balance are not a deposit and do not constitute evidence of indebtedness or liability by us to you, except to honour Proceeds as provided for in these terms. The funds associated with your Balance are not insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government deposit insurer or agency and you will not receive any interest or other earnings or returns on any funds that we handle for you. We have sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any Pooled Account. We will not voluntarily make funds available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that we handle for you. As consideration for using the Payment Services, you irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to our holding of your Balance in a Pooled Account or Reserve. If enabled, you may also choose to allocate a set percentage of any Proceeds you process through Square daily, if any, to a specific Folder of your choosing (“Automated Contributions”). By default any Proceeds will be placed in your payment balance “Payment Balance or Default Folder” and will be settled to your verified bank account as described in Section 10, subject to the payout schedule described in Section 12. If you create any Folders and choose to allocate a set percentage of any Proceeds to such Folders, such Proceeds will be held in your Balance until you initiate a transfer (note that Proceeds held in any Folder other than your Payment Balance will not be settled as described in Section 10). You can only allocate Proceeds to a Folder via Automated Contributions. You will be able to initiate a settlement to your verified bank account from any Folder as described in Section 10.You can choose to enable this feature, adjust your feature settings, and/or discontinue use of this feature by logging onto your Square Dashboard and following the appropriate prompts. If you choose to discontinue use of this feature, it may take as long as ten (10) business days to complete your request, so any allocations scheduled during this period may be initiated. In the event your Square Account is deactivated or frozen, allocation of Proceeds among any Folders within your Balance will be subject to Square’s standard process in respect of settlement of Proceeds held in your Square Balance.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">17. Our Set-off Rights</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>To the extent permitted by law, we may set off against the Balances for any obligation you owe us under any agreement with Square (e.g., Chargebacks or refunds). If you owe us an amount that exceeds your Balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your Square Account or any connected Square Account (as well as set off against any Balance in any connected Square Account). Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of these terms. You are liable for any of our costs associated with collection in addition to any amounts owed, including legal fees and expenses, and collection agency fees.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">18. Dormant Square Accounts</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>If you do not process payments through your Square Account for an extended period of time or have not linked a valid bank account, you may have a Balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under your province’s law. If this occurs, Square will provide you with notice as required by applicable law and instructions for how to transfer your Balance. If funds still remain in your Square Account, Square will transfer such funds to the applicable provincial government as required by applicable law or, as permitted, to Square.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">18. Dormant Square Accounts</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>If you do not process payments through your Square Account for an extended period of time or have not linked a valid bank account, you may have a Balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under your province’s law. If this occurs, Square will provide you with notice as required by applicable law and instructions for how to transfer your Balance. If funds still remain in your Square Account, Square will transfer such funds to the applicable provincial government as required by applicable law or, as permitted, to Square.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-36"><strong>Chargebacks</strong></h5>
    <h5 class="heading-37">19. Your Liability for Chargebacks</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>There may be times when your customer may not be the authorized user of the Card or Other Payment Method, or your customer may otherwise contest the transaction. In these instances, the amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Square Accounts (a “Chargeback”) if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the Network, our processor, or a customer or its financial institution, (c) was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these terms. You agree to comply with the Chargeback process and to the liability associated with such Chargebacks.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">20. Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, we may withhold the Chargeback amount in a Reserve. We may recoup the amount of any Chargeback and any associated Fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by a Network or our processor from your Square Accounts (including any Reserve), any proceeds due to you, or any bank account or other payment instrument linked to any of your Square Accounts. If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Square Account. Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which your customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by us for the collection of all amounts unpaid by you.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">21. Excessive Chargebacks</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish additional conditions governing your Square Account, including (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, or (d) terminating or suspending the Payment Services.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">22. Contesting Chargebacks</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>You will assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Payment Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the customer, the customer’s financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback. If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release corresponding reserved funds to your Square Account. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-36"><strong>Compliance with Network Rules and Laws</strong></h5>
    <h5 class="heading-37">23. Restricted Use</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>You will not act as a payment facilitator or otherwise resell the Payment Services to any third party. You will not use the Payment Services to handle, process or transmit funds for any third party. You also may not use the Payment Services to process cash advances.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">24. Unauthorized or Illegal Use</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>You will only accept Cards or Other Payment Methods for transactions that are allowed by applicable law. We may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe that the transaction is in violation of these terms or any other agreement with Square, or that it exposes you, your customers, other Square Sellers, our processors or Square to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts. If we suspect that your Square Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Square Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement and, as deemed necessary by Square, our payment processing and financial institution partners.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">25. Assignment of Receivables</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>With the exception of your participation in a merchant cash advance or other similar merchant financing programs, including Square Loans or Square Funding, or as otherwise required by applicable law, you will not assign Card receivables, Proceeds or any other funds due to you under these terms to any third party.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">26. Applicable Network Rules</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>By using the Payment Services, you agree to comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations set forth by the Networks (“Network Rules”). The Networks amend their rules and regulations from time to time. Square may be required to change these terms in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public at https://www.visa.ca, https://www.mastercard.ca, and https://www.americanexpress.com/ca/merchantguide. In the event of inconsistency between a Network Rule and these Payment Terms, and except as otherwise agreed between Square and the Network, the Network Rule shall apply.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">27. Taxes</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason for your use of the Payment Services (“Taxes”). You also are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we, determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. Square specifically disclaims any liability for Taxes. We will report payments and other information to regulatory and government authorities to the extent required by applicable law.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">28. Network Logos and Marks</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Your use of Network logos and marks (“Marks”) is governed by the Network Rules; you must familiarize yourself with and comply with these requirements. The Networks are the sole and exclusive owners of their respective Marks. You will not contest the ownership of the Marks, and any Network may prohibit you from using its Marks for any reason and at any time. Square may require you to make modifications to your Website or other advertising and signage in order to comply with Network Rules related to the Marks.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">29. PCI Compliance</h5>

    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Notwithstanding Section 35 of these terms or Section 16 of the General Terms, you understand that your failure to comply with the Network Rules or the PCI-DSS security standards, including the compromise of any Card information, may result in fines or other losses to Square.

    <h5 class="heading-37">34. Refunds and Returns</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>By accepting transactions through the Payment Services, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your Square Account in accordance with these Payment Terms and Network Rules. Network Rules require that you disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data. If your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the customer, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales. You can process a refund through your Square Account up to one hundred twenty (120) days from the day you accepted the payment. If you use Square Online Store, you may not be able to process a partial refund. If your available Square Balance is insufficient to cover the refund, Square will withdraw up to the requested refund amount (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from a payment instrument registered with your Square Account or any connected Square Account, including any Reserve, and credit it back into your customer’s Card. When you process a refund, the Fees are not refunded by Square, but the full purchase amount is always returned to your customer. Square has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.<br></strong></p>
    <h5 class="heading-37">35. Additional Indemnity</h5>
