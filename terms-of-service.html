    <h4 class="heading-32">10. Services</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-41"><strong>Square Services include both paid-for Services (“Paid Services”) and free Services for which no fees are charged (“Free Services”). Square offers certain Paid Services to be paid on a recurring basis (“Subscription Services”), and others on an as-used or transactional basis (“A La Carte Services”). Square has the right to change, delete, discontinue or impose conditions on Paid Services or any feature or aspect of a Paid Service. Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms. By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable taxes as set forth in your Square Account settings or as otherwise agreed in writing (“Subscription Fee”). A La Carte Services may subject you to fees charged per usage and/or terms. By using an A La Carte Service, you agree to pay the fees and any taxes incurred at the time of usage (“A La Carte Fees” and, together with Subscription Fees, the “Paid Service Fees”). All Paid Service Fees are denominated in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise specified.In general, Paid Service Fees may be paid by debit card, credit card, or deducted from your transaction proceeds.

You may cancel a Subscription Service at any time from your Square Account settings. If you cancel a Subscription Service, you will continue to have access to that Subscription Service through the end of your then current billing period, but you will not be entitled to a refund or credit for any Subscription Fee already due or paid. We reserve the right to change our Subscription Fee upon thirty (30) days’ advance notice. Your continued use of Subscription Services after notice of a change to our Subscription Fee will constitute your agreement to such changes.</strong></p>
    <h4 class="heading-32">10. Services</h4>

Upon request, you shall provide us with the necessary information to complete any applicable Tax Information reporting and recertify such Tax Information from time to time, as may be required by applicable law, or otherwise in connection with any Tax audit or examination.

YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (</strong>
      <a href="https://www.adr.org/"><strong>https://www.adr.org</strong></a><strong>), where such arbitration is conducted in the United States, or JAMS (</strong>
      <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/"><strong>https://www.jamsadr.com</strong></a><strong>) or the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Canada (</strong>
      <a href="https://www.icdr.org/"><strong>https://www.icdr.org</strong></a><strong>), where such arbitration is conducted in Canada. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies to any arbitration that takes place within the United States. Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use under a consumer protection law of a province or territory, any arbitration hearing will occur within such jurisdiction and be governed by the laws of such jurisdiction. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in (a) Toronto, Ontario, for Disputes; (b) another mutually agreeable location; or (c) a location ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. We will pay the arbitration fees due to the arbitrator for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to legal fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our legal fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Square also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) involving Square will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the provincial or federal courts in the City of Toronto, Ontario.</strong>

In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any other Square agreement or Policy, these General Terms will prevail and control the subject matter of such conflict. If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. These General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</strong></p>
